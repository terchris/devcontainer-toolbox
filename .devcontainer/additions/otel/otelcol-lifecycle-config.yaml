# File: .devcontainer/additions/otel/otelcol-lifecycle-config.yaml
# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration for Devcontainer Monitoring
# Purpose: Tracks developer activity, sends logs and system metrics to k8s observability stack
#
# This config uses OTEL's native environment variable expansion: ${env:VARIABLE_NAME}
# Variables are automatically sourced by service-otel-monitoring.sh from:
#   - ~/.devcontainer-identity (DEVELOPER_ID, DEVELOPER_EMAIL, PROJECT_NAME, TS_HOSTNAME)
#   - /workspace/.devcontainer.secrets/env-vars/.host-info (HOST_OS, HOST_USER, HOST_HOSTNAME, HOST_DOMAIN, HOST_CPU_ARCH)
#   - ~/.nginx-backend-config (NGINX_OTEL_PORT)

    logs:

      # Why: Collector runs as non-root vscode user and cannot write to /var/log/otelcol.log
      # Solution: stdout/stderr are captured by nohup in start-otel-monitoring.sh and redirected
      # to /var/log/otelcol-lifecycle.log (which has proper permissions set by the start script)
      # This avoids "permission denied" errors while still logging to /var/log/
