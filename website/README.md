# Documentation Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Live site:** https://terchris.github.io/devcontainer-toolbox/

## Development

All commands run inside the devcontainer:

```bash
cd /workspace/website

# Start development server (with hot reload)
npm run start -- --host 0.0.0.0

# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve production build locally (to test search)
npm run serve -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

> **Important:** The `--host 0.0.0.0` flag is required for VS Code port forwarding to work. Without it, the server only binds to localhost inside the container.

## Search

Local search is enabled using `@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local`.

- Search index is built during `npm run build`
- In dev mode, search shows a warning - this is normal
- To test search locally, run `npm run build` then `npm run serve`

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically via GitHub Actions when changes to `website/` are pushed to `main`.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`

To manually trigger a deploy:
1. Go to Actions → "Deploy Documentation"
2. Click "Run workflow"
