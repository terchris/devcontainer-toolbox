## The Hidden Power of Technical Decisions

When you choose a cloud SDK, a managed database, or a serverless platform, you're not just making a technical decision. You're deciding whether critical systems - hospital bookings, municipal services, emergency coordination - can function independently during geopolitical conflicts or trade disputes.

Management approves vendors based on reputation and features. But **you** understand the real bindings: proprietary SDKs, vendor-specific services, and platform lock-in that make migration nearly impossible.

## What You Can Do

Small architectural choices add up:

| Instead of | Consider |
|------------|----------|
| Vendor SDKs | Standard protocols (AMQP, OpenAPI) |
| Serverless lock-in | Containerized applications |
| Proprietary monitoring | OpenTelemetry |
| Managed databases | PostgreSQL or portable alternatives |

These aren't radical changes. They're good engineering practices that happen to preserve options.
