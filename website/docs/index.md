# DevContainer Toolbox

**One command. Full dev environment. Any project.**

Stop wasting time setting up development environments. DevContainer Toolbox gives you a complete, consistent setup that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Quick Start

**1. Install** (in your project folder):

```bash
# Mac/Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terchris/devcontainer-toolbox/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terchris/devcontainer-toolbox/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This creates a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and pulls the pre-built image.

**2. Open in VS Code** and click **"Reopen in Container"** when prompted.

Done! The container starts in seconds. Run `dev-setup` to install tools.
